** Usage

Load this script

: (require 'scratch-pop)

and you can popup scratch with "M-x scratch-pop". If a scratch is
already displayed, another scratch buffer is created. You may also
bind some keys to "scratch-pop", if you want.

: (global-set-key "C-M-s" 'scratch-pop)

When called with region, the region is yanked to the scratch.
